# Cache implementation

### User Story
As a search application API user I want to be able to get related information to some keywords I may enter in a simple form. And keep those searches in my history so I can run same search again.


### Requirements

* Node.js installed
* JMeter installes


### Step-by-step Installation

**Step 1:**
Download or clone this repository in your computer.


**Step 2:**
Enter to the API folder in your terminal:

```
cd API/
```
Then enter the following command to install all the Node.js dependencies:

```
npm install
```


**Step 3:**
To start running the API, just tyoe the following command in the same path you were on the last step:

```
nodemon app.js
```

If it's running properly, you should see a message like this in your terminal `[nodemon] starting 'node app.js'`


 
Now everything is set and you can proceed to test it.
